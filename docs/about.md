# About Our Project

Due to the significant cost to complete visual inspections with pulse power technicians, an inspection robot will be designed to complete visual pre-inspections remotely to significantly reduce technician time spent on this task and increase the number of inspections.

# Project Status

Research and development and procurement of materials.

# Getting Started

This repository can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LiamMoore27/MESMerizing_Engineers/archive/master.zip), or cloned by:
```
git clone https://github.com/MESMerizing-Engineers/MESMerizing-Engineers.git
```

## Dependencies

#### Software

[LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html) will be used to control the software and hardware of the robot.

#### Hardware & Model Creation

[CREO Parametric](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/creo/parametric) was used for creation of enclosures and other mechancial designs.

## Building

Chassis and enclosure files will be located in their respective subdirectories. These will be fabricated either with a 3D printer, a laser cutter, or water jet.

Software for the robot will have to be compiled and loaded into their respective MCU's either in LabVIEWW GPU or Nvidia.

# Acknowledgments

Thank you to the NIF team at LLNL, Bruno J. Le Galloudec, Evan Carroll, and Tyron Landrek Bettis for sponsoring EEC 193 Senior Design Project, along with Professor Rajeevan Amirtharajah. We would not have gotten this far without their help and support.
