Currently a senior at UC Davis, where I am pursuing a joint BS/MS in Electrical Engineering.  
Born and raised on Guam, I studied business administration with a concentration in Finance and Economics at the University of Guam. I worked for several years as an accountant at Louis Vuitton and later as a loan operations specialist at Citibank. I moved to San Francisco, California with plans to attend graduate school. While working in an electronic manufacturing and software start up as the Operations Manager, I was drawn towards the process of creating electronic hardware when I assisted our product development engineer who built a controller in-house for our LED billboards. I thus made a career change and pursued my interest in electronics which has brought me to UC Davis.
